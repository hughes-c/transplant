HOW TO -- Setup TransPlant
-----------------------

This README provides a quickstart guide for setting up and generating
benchmarks using TransPlant.


Building TransPlant
----------------------------------------------------

1) Go to the TransPlant directory

>  cd transplant

2) Build TransPlant

>  make

3) Generate test benchmark

> ./param inputs/ComplexAllLists.in

4) New benchmark source code located in transplant/output



Eccentricities
-------------------
It should be noted that the tool does not perform multiple checks.
Some options must either be in the descriptor file or passed as
arguments during runtime. For example, the resetPerCell value must
be included in the descriptor file as:
   resetPerCell = X
or passed as:
   -mX

-------------------

inputs        - sample of example descriptions
output        - default location for new source code
docs          - autogenerated doxygen documentation
utilities     - supporting source code
